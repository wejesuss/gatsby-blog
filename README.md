  My Gatsby's Blog
</h1>

During the 'xesquedelesson' about Gatsby, I did this mini-project or rather template of a Blog.


## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Download the repository.**

    Use your terminal to clone this repository

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/wejesuss/gatsby-blog.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new folder (probably called **'gatsby-blog'**)

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-blog/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `gatsby-blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `blog/` to create new posts. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time! You can create new folders and insert a new `index.md` file (see the 'my-first-post' folder)

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── blog
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── yarn.lock
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md 

1.  **`/blog`**: This directory contains all the posts. Create a new folder creates new posts with the name of the folder being the URL to access it. `http://localhost:8000/folder_name`

#### Obs: This repository has been done by me to learn a little about Gatsby, the project was not stylized.
